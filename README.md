# PortScanner
<p>As a pentester, you may find yourself in a situation where you are asked to not use automated scanners. In these cases, port scanning by hand can be very useful. PortScanner is a tool that can help with this process.

PortScanner is written in Python and makes use of the socket library. The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. It can be easily modified to meet your needs.

To use PortScanner, simply specify the hostname or IP address of the target system and the ports that you wish to scan. PortScanner will then attempt to connect to each port on the target system in turn and report whether it was successful or not.</p>

#How to run it
To run the PortScanner :
<ul>
<li>Install the requirements from requirements.txt with this command : <code>$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></li>

<li>On cmd enter the directory that PortScanner is located and run<code> python3 PortScanner.py</code></li>
